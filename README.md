# Ao3API

As a case study and POC this API was developed for translating the AO3 plataform resources to a JSON ready format as means to plug into other applications.

This API was developed as a .Net Core 3 App and a port as Azure Functions for serverless computing.

The objective was to simply get and clean HTML responses to JSON format, maintaning all relevant information.

## Important
As means of clarity either as legal or non-legal information.

No harm and/or copyright infringment was intended considering the recent events regarding the AO3 plataform, this is simply a POC for this functionality.
This project is not hosted in any plataform and there are no plans to do it, by the original author.

**Any and all hosted systems derived from this project have no relation whatsoever and the original author claims no right to it.**

It's also recommended to desist to do so, and if one chooses to go on with this intention, the original author demands to not be linked or having any right whatsoever. Any action taken from any party using this project as base is totally theirs.

As the plataform is open-source and non-profit this project is also.
